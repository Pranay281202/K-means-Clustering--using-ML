# K-means-Clustering--using-ML
K-means Clustering is a popular technique in Machine Learning used for partitioning data points into distinct groups or 'clusters' based on similarities in their features. The goal is to maximize the similarity within clusters while minimizing the similarity between clusters.

The process begins by randomly selecting 'centroids' for each cluster. These centroids represent the center points of the clusters. Then, each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid based on a distance metric, typically Euclidean distance.
